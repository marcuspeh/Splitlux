# Splitlux

When we go on trips in groups, expenses are often paid by one (or two) person. Our project is on splitting expenses within the group at the end of the trip. It will provide a clear breakdown of the expenses as well as reduces the effort required to decide on how the payment works.

## Backend
Branch: [backend](https://github.com/marcuspeh/Splitlux/tree/backend)

Our backend is based on Python using Django. Using Django, we used the REST framework to create the api endpoints in order for the frontend to query. Refer to the branch for more info.

## Frontend (new)
Branch: [frontend_2](https://github.com/marcuspeh/Splitlux/blob/frontend_2)

Since almost everyone will have their phones with them whatever they go, our frontend will be based on React Native, which supports both Android and iOS devices. Refer to the branch for more info.

## Frontend (old)
Branch: [frontend](https://github.com/marcuspeh/Splitlux/blob/frontend)

Similar to the frontend(new), our frontend will supports both Android and iOS devices. Hence, this is based in flutter and is used in our hackathon submission. Refer to the branch for more info.
